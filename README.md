Posting my code for challenges on project lovelace, not an entire project.

# Challenge 1: Rocket Science
Function to calculate the amount of fuel needed in kilograms (kg) to escape a planet's gravitational influence

# Challenge 2: Habitable Exoplanets
Function to determine whether a planet's given distance from its parent star is within the habitable zone to (theoretically) sustain life (contains water)

# Challenge 3: Chaos
Outputs a logistic map of the first 50 population sizes based on an initial input parameter. 

# Challenge 4: DNA Transcription
